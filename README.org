#+TITLE: Portable Kicker
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler
This is a combination of the [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit][Eric Schulte's emacs24 starter kit]] and
 [[https://github.com/dimitri/emacs-kicker][Dimitri's emacs-kicker]].  I like the idea of a literate startup as
 well as el-get's idea of getting packages from anywhere.  The
 advantage for me is my packages are managed under =git=.

This should provide a saner set of defaults than you get normally with
Emacs. It's intended for beginners, but provides a good elisp
initialization structure for all levels of users.

The main advantage of this Emacs Starter Kit are
- better default settings
- easy loading of many useful libraries and configurations
- "literate" customization embedded in Org-mode files
- an organizational directory structure
- git provides for version control, backup, and sharing
- easy instillation with no need to compile external packages
