#+TITLE: Ergoemacs Keybindings Startup
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler
* Introduction
Ergoemacs keybindings are supposed to be easier keybindings to use
than with standard emacs.  
I the colemak keyboard.  I also use ergoemacs.
* Ergoemacs +smex
To use Ergoemacs with SMEX, Control-A needs to be redefined
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun smex-if-exists (&optional prefix-arg)
    (interactive "p")
    (if (fboundp 'smex)
        (smex)
      (execute-extended-command prefix-arg)))
  
  (define-key ergoemacs-keymap "\M-a" 'smex-if-exists)
  
#+END_SRC

* Ergoemacs -- Please use regular expression searching
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key ergoemacs-keymap [remap isearch-forward] 'isearch-forward-regexp)
  (define-key ergoemacs-keymap [remap isearch-backward] 'isearch-backward-regexp)
#+END_SRC

* Remove silly Ergoemacs keys.
I really don't think that =M-x= and =M-c= =M-z= are very useful since
the control variants do the /exact same thing/.  Silly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key ergoemacs-keymap "\M-c" nil)
  (define-key ergoemacs-keymap "\M-x" nil)
  (define-key ergoemacs-keymap "\M-z" nil)
#+END_SRC

Also this interferes with ESS-tracebug's default prefix key of =\M-c=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ergoemacs-mode 1)
  (cua-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
